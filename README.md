## 🚀 Blogs made Simple ..

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. In `src/components/` you can place any  Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. Static assets are in the `public/` directory.

| File layout            | Similar to svelte. Use .astro or .md (markdown)     |
|                        | Uses --- instead of script tags as in svelte        |
|                        | Uses script tags for dynamic js                     |
| props                  | use export interface Props (sv uses export let      |
| svelte, react etc      | npm run astro add svelte                            |
| Blog                 ` | Uses posts folder/ files and Astro simply gets these|
